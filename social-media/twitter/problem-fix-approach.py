# Data engineering roles can vary widely, even in similar-sized companies. To level up, focus on:
#
# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Domain expertise: Know your data, its sources, usage, and industry-specific insights. 
#
# 2Ô∏è‚É£ Tech skills: Master SQL, Python, SWE best practices, CI/CD, and distributed data processing.
#
# These will accelerate your career! üöÄ

# Figuring out what to learn to be able to ‚Äúdata engineer‚Äù is sometimes more difficult than the actual job!
#
# Instead of trying to learn everything that are posted in a job description, a better way would be to have the foundations locked down.
#
# Check out this practical DE roadmap that will give you the confidence to dig deep into your area of interest:
#
# 1. SQL: Basics and advanced. Use this repo to learn the basics and advanced topics: https://github.com/josephmachado/adv_data_transformation_in_sql.
#
# 2. Python: Basics (data structures, control flow) and how to extract, transform, and load data. Use this repo to learn basics and ETL in Python: https://github.com/josephmachado/python_essentials_for_data_engineers
#
# 3. Building data pipelines and orchestrating: Play around with an Airflow DAG, see how the code corresponds to the DAG, how environment variables are set, and how data is transformed. Use this post to get started: https://www.startdataengineering.com/post/data-engineering-project-for-beginners-batch-edition/
#
# 4. Distributed data processing fundamentals: Dig into how data is processed in parallel and how storage is optimized for read patterns. Use this course to dig into Spark and its implementation details: https://josephmachado.podia.com/efficient-data-processing-in-spark
#
# Put them together following principles here https://www.startdataengineering.com/post/data-engineering-project-to-impress-hiring-managers/
